     width: 50%;
     transition: width 0.5s ease-in-out;
   }
   ```

326. Q: What is the box model in CSS?
   A: The box model is a fundamental concept in CSS that describes how elements are rendered on a web page. It consists of four layers: content, padding, border, and margin. The content layer represents the actual content of the element, such as text or images. The padding layer surrounds the content and provides space between the content and the border. The border layer creates a visible boundary around the element. Finally, the margin layer is the space between the element and neighboring elements. Understanding the box model is crucial for controlling the layout and spacing of elements on a web page.

327. Q: What is the difference between inline and block elements in HTML?
   A: Inline elements and block elements are two different types of HTML elements that affect how content is displayed on a web page. Inline elements do not start on a new line and only occupy the space necessary to display their content. Examples of inline elements are `<span>`, `<a>`, and `<strong>`. On the other hand, block elements start on a new line and occupy the full width available. They create a block-level box that can contain other elements. Examples of block elements are `<div>`, `<p>`, and `<h1>` to `<h6>`. The distinction between inline and block elements is essential for controlling the layout and structure of HTML documents.

328. Q: What is the CSS selector specificity and how does it work?
   A: CSS selector specificity is a way to determine which CSS rule takes precedence when multiple rules target the same element. Specificity is calculated based on the type of selectors used in the CSS rule. Selectors are assigned a specific weight, and the rule with the highest specificity value will be applied. The specificity hierarchy is as follows: inline styles (highest), IDs, classes, attributes, pseudo-classes, elements (lowest). For example, a rule with an ID selector (`#example`) has higher specificity than a rule with a class selector (`.example`). If conflicting rules have the same specificity, the one defined later in the CSS will override the previous one.

329. Q: What is the "box-sizing" property in CSS?
   A: The "box-sizing" property in CSS controls how the total width and height of an element are calculated. The default value is "content-box", which means that the width and height only include the content and do not account for padding, border, or margin. When "box-sizing" is set to "border-box", the width and height of an element include the content, padding, and border, but not the margin. This property is useful when working with responsive layouts or when you want to include padding and border in the total size of an element.

330. Q: What is the difference between relative, absolute, and fixed positioning in CSS?
   A: Relative positioning, absolute positioning, and fixed positioning are different ways to position elements on a web page in CSS. Relative positioning allows an element to be moved relative to its normal position, while the space it would have taken remains reserved. Absolute positioning positions an element relative to its nearest positioned ancestor or the document's initial containing block. The space it would have taken is no longer reserved, and other elements can occupy that space. Fixed positioning positions an element relative to the viewport, so it stays fixed even when the page is scrolled.

331. Q: How can you center an element horizontally and vertically using CSS?
   A: You can center an element horizontally and vertically using CSS by applying a combination of positioning and transformation techniques.

   Example:
   ```html
   <div class="container">
     <div class="centered-element">
       <p>Centered content</p>
     </div>
   </div>
   ```
   ```css
   .container {
     position: relative;
     height: 100vh;
     display: flex;
     align-items: center;
     justify-content: center;
   }

   .centered-element {
     position: absolute;
     top: 50%;
     left: 50%;
     transform: translate(-50%, -50%);
   }
   ```

332. Q: How can you create a responsive navigation menu using CSS?
   A: You can create a responsive navigation menu using CSS by utilizing media queries and flexbox or grid layout.

   ```html
   <nav class="navigation">
     <ul class="menu">
       <li><a href="#">Home</a></li>
       <li><a href="#">About</a></li>
       <li><a href="#">Services</a></li>
       <li><a href="#">Contact</a></li>
     </ul>

     text-decoration: none;
     color: #333;
     padding: 10px;
     transition: background-color 0.3s;
   }

   .menu li a:hover {
     background-color: #ccc;
   }

   /* Responsive Styles */
   @media (max-width: 768px) {
     .menu {
       flex-direction: column;
       align-items: center;
     }

     .menu li {
       margin: 10px 0;
     }
   }
   ```

333. Q: How can you create a sticky footer using CSS?
   A: You can create a sticky footer using CSS by setting the height of the content area to 100% and utilizing flexbox or grid layout.

   <body>
     <div class="content">
       <p>Content goes here</p>
     </div>
     <footer class="footer">
       <p>Footer content</p>
     </footer>
   </body>
